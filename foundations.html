        <h2>Progressive enhancement</h2>
        <p><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement/">Progressive enhancement</a> means starting with the most basic unit possible &mdash; in our case, plain HTML &mdash; and treating everything else as something that might optionally enhance the experience for those who can get it. This way, everything always works, period.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We start with the cleanest, most semantic HTML that we can write. Semantic HTML makes it easier for other parties to use our markup. Critically, screen readers and other accessibility tools count among those &ldquo;other parties,&rdquo; so semantic HTML makes the single biggest difference possible to make our sites accessible.</li>
          <li>If you can load CSS, then you can see a styled page. Very few people should encounter problems with CSS, but if it happens, the page remains usable, even if unstyled.</li>
          <li>Some people will have wider screens. If you do, our CSS can <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">respond</a> to take advantage of that space with a better layout. As one part of this, the typography itself responds to the size of the window, using a technique called <em>responsive typography</em>.</li>
          <li>Most people will successfully download and execute JavaScript, allowing for client-side enhancements, like drag-and-drop file uploads. JavaScript can fail for a long list of reasons. When this happens, you still get a functional page, because our client-side JavaScript only enhances an existing experience.</li>
